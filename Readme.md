1️⃣ Created the full project structure for UDE (Monorepo)

Project is now organized like a real production system:
    UDE/
    ├── client/        → React dashboard (frontend)
    ├── server/        → Node backend (empty now)
    ├── packages/
    │     └── sdk-js/  → JavaScript SDK (you built this!)
    └── package.json   → workspace configuration

This monorepo structure is strong, scalable, and used by all serious platforms (Segment, Supabase, Vercel, Stripe).


2️⃣ Turned the whole project into an npm workspace (monorepo)

Added this to the root package.json:
    "workspaces": ["client", "server", "packages/*"]
This makes npm treat all sub-projects as connected, so you can:
	•	share code between them
	•	auto-install dependencies
	•	import SDK inside client directly
	•	manage everything from one repo

3️⃣ Set up the packages/sdk-js folder correctly

Inside packages/, Created a:
    sdk-js/
 ├── package.json
 └── index.js
This is the official home for UDE JavaScript SDK.






4️⃣ Created the first version of the UDE JavaScript SDK

SDK now supports:

✔ Anonymous ID generation
Stored in localStorage so each user has a unique ID.

✔ track()
Sends events to the backend /track API.

✔ identify()
Links anonymous users to a logged-in user.

✔ Automatic networking
Using fetch to send data to your backend.

✔ Base URL setup
Currently pointing to:
this.baseURL = "http://localhost:3000"

✔ SDK exported as a singleton:
export default new UDESDK();

This allows usage like:
import ude from "@ude/sdk-js";

ude.track("product_view", { id: 1 });
ude.identify("user123", { email: "mayank@gmail.com" });


5️⃣ Successfully linked the SDK into your monorepo
When We ran:
    npm install
npm detected your SDK package:
    added 1 package
Which means:
	•	SDK is correctly registered
	•	Monorepo is healthy
	•	Everything is connected







🎯 NEXT STEP = LEVEL 2 (Essential Analytics Features)

These are MUST-HAVE before building a dashboard or SDK.

Below is the correct order.

⸻

✅ STEP 1 — Add More Read APIs (backend)

Your users will want to see analytics.
For analytics, you need more endpoints beyond /events/recent.

Add these:

1. /events/count

→ How many times an event happened
(Example: number of signups)

2. /events/by-day

→ Time-series graph
(Example: signups per day)

3. /profiles/:id

→ Fetch a complete user profile
(identifiers + traits)

4. /profiles/search

→ Search user by email / user_id / anonymous_id

These 4 APIs give you 80% of analytics.

⸻
==============================================================Completed till here=================================

✅ STEP 2 — Build Session Tracking (Automatic)

Every modern analytics system needs sessions:

Why?
	•	Track time on app
	•	Count unique users
	•	Understand journeys
	•	Build funnels

You will add:
	•	session_id generation logic
	•	Start/end timestamps
	•	Session table in ClickHouse

⸻

✅ STEP 3 — Build Funnels

Funnels =
signup → open_app → view_product → add_to_cart → purchase

This is real analytics.

To do funnels, you need:
	•	SQL queries in ClickHouse that join events by profile_id
	•	/funnels API
	•	Backend logic to compute conversion rate

⸻

✅ STEP 4 — Build User Journey API

Example:
/journey/:profileId

Returns:

[
  { event: "signup", timestamp: ... },
  { event: "open_app", timestamp: ... },
  { event: "view_product", timestamp: ... }
]


This powers the “Activity Timeline” like Mixpanel.


Add /events/count and /events/by-day endpoints

This is VERY EASY — I can write the code for you.

Example:

/events/count?event=signup

Returns:{ count: 1241 }


/events/by-day?event=view_product

Returns:
[
  { day: "2025-12-10", count: 11 },
  { day: "2025-12-11", count: 27 }
]


🚀 If you want, I’ll generate:

✔ Full backend code

✔ Routes

✔ ClickHouse queries

✔ Frontend dashboard components (charts)

Just tell me:



======================================================================

We’ll add:
	•	unique users
	•	funnels
	•	retention (day-1, day-7)




📚 What YOU should learn next (so you can do this alone)

1️⃣ Redis patterns
	•	key design (profile:*, id:*)
	•	when to denormalize
	•	TTL vs permanent keys

2️⃣ ClickHouse basics
	•	MergeTree vs ReplacingMergeTree
	•	GROUP BY, toDate, countDistinct
	•	why ClickHouse ≠ PostgreSQL

3️⃣ Express routing (you just learned this)
	•	mount paths
	•	router separation
	•	stats vs resources



🚀 What comes NEXT (when you say “next”)
	•	Unique users (countDistinct(profile_id))
	•	Funnels (signup → purchase)
	•	Retention (day 1 / day 7)
	•	Sessionization
	•	Export-ready analytics APIs

Say “next” and we’ll continue step-by-step like a real system design interview 👌























🟢 STEP 1 — Finish Profiles (DO THIS NEXT)

What to build
	1.	/profiles/:id
	2.	/profiles/search
	3.	Write profiles to ClickHouse

Why first?

Because everything else depends on profiles.

Even Mixpanel UI starts from profiles.

⸻

🟢 STEP 2 — Make Event Schema Strict

Right now:
	•	Everything is JSON
	•	No validation

Next:
	•	Enforce required fields
	•	Extract common fields (device, browser, country)

This improves:
	•	Data quality
	•	Future analytics
	•	Query speed

🟢 STEP 3 — SDK Contract (VERY IMPORTANT)

Before more backend features, define:
{
  event,
  distinct_id,
  properties,
  context,
  timestamp
}

Why?
	•	SDKs depend on this
	•	Backend becomes stable
	•	No breaking changes later

⸻

🟢 STEP 4 — Only THEN Analytics

Counts, uniques, trends — you already started this correctly.

But analytics without solid data = useless.

⸻

4️⃣ What YOU Should Learn Alongside (So You Can Do This Alone)

While building Step 1, learn ONLY this:

Redis
	•	Key design
	•	Indexing patterns
	•	TTL (later)

ClickHouse
	•	MergeTree vs ReplacingMergeTree
	•	Why ORDER BY matters
	•	JSON vs columns

Product Thinking
	•	“Who will call this API?”
	•	“What breaks if Redis restarts?”
	•	“How do I debug a bad profile merge?”

⸻

5️⃣ Reality Check (Important)

What you’ve built already is better than 90% resume projects.

But to be Mixpanel-level, the discipline is:
	•	Correct data model
	•	Boring correctness
	•	No premature analytics

You are on the right path.





















































To be able to do this yourself later, learn:

🔹 Data Modeling
	•	Entities vs Events
	•	One-to-many relationships
	•	Identity graphs

🔹 Redis patterns
	•	Index keys
	•	Lookup tables
	•	Caching vs source of truth

🔹 Analytics DBs
	•	Why ClickHouse > Postgres for events
	•	Append-only data
	•	Columnar storage
While building Step 1, learn ONLY this:

Redis
	•	Key design
	•	Indexing patterns
	•	TTL (later)

ClickHouse
	•	MergeTree vs ReplacingMergeTree
	•	Why ORDER BY matters
	•	JSON vs columns

	•	“What breaks if Redis restarts?”
	•	“How do I debug a bad profile merge?”












	A real UDE is not just:
	•	/track
	•	/identify
	•	counts

A real UDE is 4 systems working together:

Data Ingestion  →  Identity System  →  Data Store  →  Analytics Layer

You are currently here:
Data Ingestion  →  Identity System  →  Data Store  ✅

1️⃣ Event System (You only have BASIC v1)

What you have now
	•	signup
	•	purchase
	•	page_view
	•	arbitrary events

What real tools support

A. Event Taxonomy (VERY IMPORTANT)
Mixpanel forces teams to define:
	•	Event names
	•	Allowed properties
	•	Property types

Example:
Event: Purchase
Properties:
- amount (number)
- currency (string)
- product_id (string)

Event: Purchase
Properties:
- amount (number)
- currency (string)
- product_id (string)

signup.v1
signup.v2

Why?
	•	Product evolves
	•	Old SDKs still send old events

👉 Missing

⸻

C. Event Sampling & Throttling
If someone sends:
	•	10M events/min
	•	Or a buggy loop

System should:
	•	Sample
	•	Drop
	•	Rate limit

👉 Missing


2️⃣ Identity & Profile System (You are strong here, but not complete)

What you already have ✅
	•	anonymous → logged-in merge
	•	multiple identifiers
	•	Redis for fast lookup

What real systems add

A. Profile History
Not just latest profile, but:
plan: free → pro → enterprise

B. Profile Computed Properties
Examples:
	•	last_seen_at
	•	total_events
	•	lifetime_value

These are auto-calculated.

👉 Missing

⸻

C. Profile Deletion (GDPR)
	•	Delete user data
	•	Forget profile permanently

👉 Missing but mandatory in real products

⸻

3️⃣ Analytics Layer (You just started)

You currently have:
	•	count
	•	by-day

That’s 10% of analytics.

Real analytics features

A. Core Metrics
	•	Unique users
	•	Active users (DAU, WAU, MAU)
	•	Event frequency
	•	Average per user

⸻

B. Funnels (VERY IMPORTANT)
Example:
Visited site → Signup → Purchase

Shows:
	•	Drop-offs
	•	Conversion %

👉 Huge missing piece

⸻

C. Retention
Example:
	•	Users active after 1 day
	•	After 7 days
	•	After 30 days

👉 This is Mixpanel’s killer feature

⸻

D. Cohorts
Example:
Users who signed up last week AND plan = pro

👉 Missing

⸻

4️⃣ Segmentation Engine (BIG GAP)

Segments power everything.

Examples:
	•	Paid users
	•	Users from India
	•	Users with >5 sessions

Segments are:
	•	Dynamic
	•	Reusable
	•	Query-based

👉 You don’t have a segment system yet.

⸻

5️⃣ Data Governance (People ignore this, products don’t)

Real tools have:

A. Schema enforcement
	•	Property type checks
	•	Required fields

B. Data debugging tools
	•	Event inspector
	•	Raw payload viewer

C. Environment separation
	•	dev
	•	staging
	•	prod

👉 Missing

⸻

6️⃣ Integrations (This is why CDPs exist)

Real UDEs connect to:
	•	Google Ads
	•	Meta Ads
	•	Email tools
	•	Webhooks
	•	Data warehouses

They support:
	•	Forwarding events
	•	Transforming payloads

👉 Missing (but future phase)

⸻

7️⃣ SDK Ecosystem (You haven’t started yet)

Mixpanel is powerful because:
	•	JS SDK
	•	Mobile SDKs
	•	Server SDKs

Each SDK:
	•	Queues events
	•	Retries on failure
	•	Batches requests

👉 Missing

⸻

8️⃣ Reliability & Scale (Hidden but CRITICAL)

Real systems include:
	•	Retry queues
	•	Dead-letter queues
	•	Backpressure handling
	•	Async ingestion

Right now your /track is sync.

👉 Fine for now, but not scalable.

⸻

Now the IMPORTANT question you asked

“I want anyone can do anything like real UDE”

That means:

Users should be able to:
	•	Define events
	•	Define properties
	•	Build funnels
	•	Create segments
	•	Explore data without SQL

Your backend becomes:

A data platform, not an API

⸻

⸻

Next logical step (when you’re ready)

You choose ONE:
1️⃣ Map Mixpanel UI → backend APIs
2️⃣ Design Funnels engine architecture
3️⃣ Design Segments engine
4️⃣ Design SDK contract





































🔴 The Correct Next Step (DO THIS)

STEP 1 — Create an Event Registry (No analytics yet)

Why this first?

Because right now:
	•	Anyone can send anything
	•	Typos = new events
	•	Properties have no meaning
	•	Data quality will degrade fast

Mixpanel’s power comes from this layer.

⸻

What Is Event Registry? (Simple)

It is metadata about events, NOT events themselves.

Event Name.    Status.    First Seen.      Properties
signup.        active.    2025-01-01.      email, plan
purchase       active.    2025-01-02       price, currency
signpu         invalid.   2025-01-02       ❌ typo


What You Should Build (Conceptually)

1️⃣ Event definitions

For each event:
	•	name
	•	description
	•	allowed properties
	•	property types
	•	required / optional
	•	first_seen_at
	•	last_seen_at

2️⃣ Property definitions

For each property:
	•	key
	•	type (string, number, bool)
	•	example value
	•	which events use it

3️⃣ Status tracking
	•	active
	•	deprecated
	•	experimental
	•	blocked

What This Enables (Massive Benefits)

Once you have this:
	•	New events can be added safely
	•	SDKs can be auto-validated
	•	Analytics becomes reliable
	•	UI can be auto-generated
	•	Teams won’t break data accidentally

This is why Mixpanel scales across teams.

⸻

STEP 2 — Event Validation Layer (Soft, Not Strict)

After registry exists:
	•	If event is unknown → accept + log
	•	If property type mismatch → warn
	•	If required property missing → warn

⚠️ Do NOT block events yet
➡️ Just observe and record violations

⸻

STEP 3 — Canonical Event Contract (Freeze this)

Define once:
{
  "event": "string",
  "distinct_id": "string",
  "properties": {},
  "context": {},
  "timestamp": "ISO"
}

Why now?
	•	SDKs depend on this
	•	Backend becomes stable
	•	Mobile SDKs become easy

This is non-negotiable for real systems.

STEP 4 — Derived Data (Light Analytics)

Only after steps above:
	•	Unique users
	•	DAU / WAU
	•	Per-event funnels
	•	Retention basics

Now analytics will actually mean something.

⸻

What NOT To Do Right Now ❌

❌ Advanced dashboards
❌ Funnels UI
❌ ML / predictions
❌ Campaign triggers

These come much later.

⸻

Learning Path For YOU (So You Can Do This Yourself)

You should learn:
	1.	Event-driven systems
	2.	Schema-on-read vs schema-on-write
	3.	Data quality concepts
	4.	Analytics warehouse design
	5.	Identity graphs (you already started)

You are already ahead of most devs here.

⸻

One-Line Answer to “What should I do next?”

Build an Event Registry so your system can accept unlimited future events without breaking or degrading data quality.

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Design Event Registry schema
	•	Design how /track updates registry
	•	Design how Mixpanel UI comes from this
	•	Design SDK validation flow


	High-Level Components of Event Registry

You need 4 core registries:
	1.	Events Registry
	2.	Event Properties Registry
	3.	Property Dictionary (global)
	4.	Event Observations (auto-tracked)


11️⃣ What you should learn alongside this

From your side, learn:
	1.	Columnar databases (ClickHouse basics)
	2.	Schema evolution concepts
	3.	Event-driven data modeling
	4.	Why analytics data ≠ transactional data

You are already doing system design, not CRUD.


What you should study alongside

From your side:
	1.	ClickHouse MergeTree engines
	2.	Columnar vs row databases
	3.	Event-driven data modeling
	4.	Schema evolution patterns
	5.	Why analytics systems avoid updates

You are doing real data engineering now, not backend CRUD.

7️⃣ What YOU should learn alongside this (important)

To truly own this system, learn:

1. Data modeling mindset
	•	Event vs Metadata vs State
	•	Append vs Upsert tables

2. ClickHouse basics
	•	MergeTree
	•	ReplacingMergeTree
	•	countDistinct
	•	toDate
	•	LowCardinality(String)

3. Analytics concepts
	•	Schema drift
	•	Cardinality
	•	Late data
	•	Idempotency

You are already touching all of these.
9️⃣ What you should learn from this step

From YOUR side, understand:
	1.	Difference between data vs metadata
	2.	Why schema evolution matters
	3.	Why not validating early is smart
	4.	How large systems avoid breaking changes

This thinking matters more than code.

🔥 FINAL ORDER (IMPORTANT)

✅ Step 0 — DONE
	•	Events
	•	Profiles
	•	Registry
	•	Storage

🟢 Step 1 — Event Contract Definition
You freeze one canonical JSON shape
(This affects SDKs, backend, future teams)

🟢 Step 2 — Context Standardization
Decide:
	•	Required context keys
	•	Optional context keys

🟢 Step 3 — Event Naming Rules
Enforce:
	•	Namespaced names
	•	Lowercase
	•	Dot-separated
	•	No spaces

🟢 Step 4 — Soft Validation
	•	Warn on unknown properties
	•	Warn on type drift
	•	Still ingest data

🧩 The Universal Event Model (Industry Standard)

Every serious analytics system converges to this shape:
{
  "event": "string",
  "identifiers": {},
  "properties": {},
  "context": {},
  "timestamp": ""
}









Date 22 Dec

🧩 What to build NEXT (exact order)

✅ STEP 1 — Event Registry (you already started this)

You already have:
	•	event_registry table
	•	property type detection
	•	first_seen / last_seen

👏 This is correct.

⸻

🟢 STEP 2 — Schema Diff + Type Change Detection (THIS IS NEXT)

Right now:
	•	You insert
	•	You don’t compare

You must add logic like:

“This property was number, now it’s string — mark it”

What this gives you:
	•	Breaking change detection
	•	SDK version bugs
	•	Analytics reliability

This does not block ingestion.

⸻

🟢 STEP 3 — Schema Status States

Each property should have a status:
active
deprecated
type_changed
unstable
Why?
	•	UI can hide unstable fields
	•	Analytics can ignore bad data
	•	Engineers get warnings

⸻

🟢 STEP 4 — Expose Schema APIs

Only after Steps 1–3.

Because now your schema is:
	•	Accurate
	•	Historical
	•	Trustworthy

⸻

🟢 STEP 5 — Version-aware ingestion (later)
{
  "event": "signup",
  "sdk_version": "1.3.2"
}

So you can answer:
	•	“Which SDK broke this event?”
	•	“Which version sent bad data?”

	🔑 Why this path guarantees “doesn’t break at all”

Because:
	•	You never reject data
	•	You never overwrite blindly
	•	You never assume types
	•	You always record history

👉 This is enterprise-grade ingestion philosophy.

⸻

🧠 Mental model to remember

Ingestion must be flexible
Analytics must be strict

The schema layer is the buffer between chaos and order.

✅ Final answer (very short)

The next thing you should build is:

Soft Schema Governance Layer on top of your Event Registry

That’s the foundation that allows:
	•	Infinite new events
	•	Infinite new properties
	•	Zero breaking changes
	•	Trustworthy analytics

⸻

If you want, next I can:
	•	Design the exact schema states
	•	Improve your eventRegistry.service.js
	•	Show how Mixpanel internally models this
	•	Or plan the next 6 months roadmap


	

Date 26Dec2025
Before ANY dashboards, you need a strong ingestion core:

1️⃣ Make schema API complete

Expose backend endpoints so FE can rely on backend:
	•	/schema/events  (✔ already)
	•	/schema/events/:event  (✔ already)
	•	/schema/conflicts  (❌ must build)
	•	/schema/properties/global  (❌ must build — list all properties across all events)

2️⃣ Fix ingestion correctness

Add:
	•	Reserved-key enforcement (blocks SDK from sending user_id inside properties)
	•	Strict timestamp normalization
	•	Required event structure validation
	•	Reject events when contract violated (not just log)

3️⃣ Add batching & async queue

Current → /track inserts DB synchronously → slow + unsafe
Upgrade to:
			SDK ---> POST /track/batch  (max 100)
					|
				queue (Redis list or Kafka mini)
					|
				worker ---> ClickHouse bulk insert
4️⃣ Add enrichment

Real UDE adds:

country
device
browser
os
ip
referrer
session_id
page_duration

→ must auto-extract inside backend, not sent by SDK.

5️⃣ Add dead-letter storage

When schema mismatch fails → event MUST NOT be lost
Store:

ude.dead_events





















Which one do you want to do NEXT?

A️⃣ Auto-Capture Context (device, ip, page, referrer)
B️⃣ Enrich Profile Traits from Events (plan, price, etc.)
C️⃣ Add Analytics APIs (active users, funnels, cohorts)




2
🔹 A — Batch ingestion /track/batch
Send 100 events at once — performance + SDK-like

🔹 B — Async queue worker
Insert events into Redis first → ClickHouse async

🔹 C — Enrichment
Auto extract IP → geo → device → OS → browser


Layer
Status
Event ingestion (/track)
✔ working
Profile merge (Redis + ClickHouse)
✔ working
Schema tracking
✔ now stable
Contract validation
⚠️ basic only
Conflicts logging
⚠️ logged, NOT queryable
Batching
❌ missing
Async pipeline
❌ missing
Event replay / retries
❌ missing
Dead letter queue
❌ missing
Real-time enrichment (geo, device)
❌ missing
Rate limiting
❌ missing
Authentication for SDK
❌ missing
Multi-tenant support
❌ missing


Reply with ONE letter:

A — Build /schema/conflicts API + UI-ready output
→ So you can see which SDKs are sending wrong data

B — Add “reserved keys” enforcement on properties
→ Prevent SDKs from sending user_id or user_email inside properties

C — Begin “Auto-Segments” (e.g., premium users, users from India)
→ First product analytics insights

D — Add batching endpoint /track/batch for 50K events/sec
→ Makes ingestion production-g








🧭 MASTER ROADMAP — Full UDE (User-Data-Engine) System

Final goal: A platform equivalent to Mixpanel + Segment + Rudderstack (self-hosted analytics + profiles + ingestion + schema validation + dashboards).

⸻

✅ 1️⃣ Phase — Core Data Ingestion (DONE by you)

Already built:
✔ POST /track – store event
✔ POST /identify – update traits & identities
✔ Redis profile merge / anonymous → known
✔ ClickHouse tables – events, profiles
✔ Auto-schema registry — event_registry
✔ Schema mismatch warning logs
✔ /schema/events, /schema/:event — schema explorer
✔ Unique counts, by-day, latest events API

🔥 This is enough to collect millions of events — foundation is complete.

⸻

🟧 2️⃣ Phase — Schema Contract System (PARTIALLY DONE)

Goal = prevent garbage data, enforce clean data contracts.

Already done:
✔ Track schema of every event field
✔ Detect type mismatches

Still missing (must build):
Feature                          Description
Schema enforcement toggle        system-wide flag — if ON → reject bad events
Property allow/block list        Choose which fields are allowed
Event approval workflow          New events appear as “pending” until approved
Schema history                   Store versions + who changed what
Validation rules                 min-max length, enum values, regex, etc.


APIs to add:
POST /schema/settings      { enforce: true }
POST /schema/approve       { event, property, type }
POST /schema/block         { event, property }
GET  /schema/pending



🟦 3️⃣ Phase — Profiles System Expansion (NOT DONE YET)

Goal = Real-time user profile like Mixpanel People Analytics

To build:


Feature                                  Why
Profile timeline                    GET /profiles/:id/timeline
Profile events summary              first seen, last seen, top actions
Computed fields                     LTV, session_count, avg spend
Identity merge strategies           map user_id + email + device_id
Profile export APIs                 CSV / webhook / sync to external tools

Extra ClickHouse tables to add:
profile_sessions
profile_aggregates


🟨 4️⃣ Phase — Analytics Engine (NOT DONE)

Goal = provide Mixpanel UI charts programmatically

Analytics                                Why
Funnels (signup → trial → pay)           Conversion
Cohorts (users who did X but not Y)      Retention
Retention curves (D1, D7, W4)            Health
Group analytics (company_id → B2B SaaS)  B2B use case
Revenue tracking.                        MRR / ARPU

APIs to build:

GET /analytics/funnel?steps=signup,trial_start,checkout
GET /analytics/retention?event=login&period=7d
GET /analytics/revenue/mrr





🟩 5️⃣ Phase — Dashboard UI (NOT STARTED)

A React dashboard for debugging & analytics

Screens to build:
1️⃣ Live Event Stream
2️⃣ Schema Explorer (show mismatches)
3️⃣ Profile Viewer (timeline + traits)
4️⃣ Funnels dashboard
5️⃣ Settings (schema enforcement toggle)

This is where product becomes real.

⸻

🟪 6️⃣ Phase — SDKs (To make platform usable by others)

What to build

SDK                                    Why
JavaScript browser SDK             embed in websites
Node SDK                           backend apps
React hook: useAnalytics()         easy frontend usage
Later: Swift + Kotlin mobile sdk.  apps


Example browser code:

import UDE from "@ude/js"

UDE.track("signup", { plan:"pro" }, { user_id: 123 })

🟥 7️⃣ Phase — Scalability (Optional, Later)

Once system handles 100M events/month

Add:Component                        Why
Kafka ingestion buffer             async batching
Redis Stream for retries           reliability
ClickHouse Materialized Views      aggregated tables
TTL policies                       auto delete 1-year old events
Multi-tenant / RBAC                SaaS version


🔁 TL;DR – Everything on One List (Chronological Build Order)

📌 DONE
	•	Event ingestion
	•	Identity resolution
	•	ClickHouse events/profiles
	•	Event registry + schema tracking
	•	Conflicts logging

🧱 NEXT BUILD
(1) Schema enforcement system
(2) Profiles timeline & aggregates
(3) Analytics APIs (funnels/retention)
(4) React dashboard UI
(5) Developer SDKs
(6) Scalability upgrades

🧠 Your Next Task (Immediate)

👉 Finish schema enforcement before anything else
Because without enforcing contract → everything downstream breaks.
